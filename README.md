#Problem sets from the OCW 6.00 course Intro to Computer Science and Programming!

The course is an intro to CS concepts and programming in Python.  It took me about 4 weeks to watch all the lectures and almost finish all the psets! This repo has my (partial) solutions to the psets...

## Topics
* search methods
* algorithmic complexity and big O notation
* recursion
* memoisation
* dynamic programming
* classes and hashing
* sampling and monte carlo simulations
* optimisation and greedy algorithms (0-1 knapsack problem)
* clustering (k-means and hierarchichal)
* graph algorithms (depth first search, breadth first search)
* queuing network models
